Example solution for up to Stage 4 (Extreme) of the Push API IMDb track of Coveo Power Up Challenge.

https://levelup.coveo.com/learn/courses/power-up-coding-push-api-imdb/lessons/stage4-extreme

`crawl.py` scrapes and uploads the movie data, using https://github.com/coveo-labs/SDK-Push-Stream-Python

You'll need to provide your own test org and replace the parts that say `yr_api_key`, `yr_org_id`, and `yr_src_id`.
